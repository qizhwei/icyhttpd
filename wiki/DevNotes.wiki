== TODOs ==
  * fatal error
  * process local storage (alloc many times, free once on process termination)
  * implement http protocol (by using getline, hash table to store headers, arch should be able to serve as server, gateway and proxy)
  * fastcgi pool (migrate)
  * hash table (migrate)
  * fifo pipe (migrate, if needed)

== server arch ==
a server has:
  * multiple endpoints (ipv4, ipv6, etc.)
  * multiple websites
  * multiple handlers

an endpoint has:
  * multiple host bindings (<host, website> pair)
  * at most one non-host binding
  * at most one proxy

a website is a virtual directory

a virtual directory has:
  * multiple virtual directory bindings (<name, virtual_dir>)
  * a handler list, sorted by priority (which can be filesystem, fastcgi, etc.)
  * an error handler (if needed?)

a handler is a component implements an specified interface
