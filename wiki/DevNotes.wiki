== TODOs ==

  * fatal error
  * process local storage (alloc many times, free once on process termination)
  * implement http protocol (by using getline, hash table to store headers, arch should be able to serve as server, gateway and proxy)
  * fastcgi pool (migrate from [http://code.google.com/p/icyhttpd/source/browse/?r=13 rev 13])
  * hash table (migrate from [http://code.google.com/p/icyhttpd/source/browse/?r=13 rev 13])
  * fifo pipe (migrate from [http://code.google.com/p/icyhttpd/source/browse/?r=13 rev 13], if needed)
  * utf8 string data structure (do we need size field?)
  * reduce and restructure semaphore (if don't needed)

== waitone, waitall and waitany implementation ==

imagining the following arch:
{{{
blocking_operation_0();
blocking_operation_1();
blocking_operation_2();
...
blocking_operation_n-1();
wait(how_many_signals_waiting_for);
}}}

it's cool, let's make it real
